## Architecture Overview

## Approach to scalability and potential improvements

- To separate products and orders into different microservices with its own database.
- Use API gateway for load balancing, distributing API requests across microservices, API logs and etc.
- An OAuth2 server to handle authorization for different clients.
- Apply caching(Redis) method in frontend and microservices for frequent access data, i.e. order list, product general info.

## Assumptions Made During Development

- A very early stage of order microservice in an ERP system. It handles order's basic CRUD.
- A microservice handles Product's CRUD.
- Communication between microservices occurs within a secure internal network.
- Order Data Volume Is Manageable.

## AI Usage Log

- API Prompt where mainly focus in getting overall idea and generating boilerplate of the project using [ChatGpt](https://chatgpt.com/share/68ec5e1c-f2b8-800b-9288-82415e8d28ca).
